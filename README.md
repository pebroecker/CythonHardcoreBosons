# CythonHardcoreBosons
Stochastic Series Simulation of Hardcore Bosons on a Square Lattice written in Cython

The preliminary prototype was written in Julia, which can still be seen from the fact that the job creation script is written in Julia. Results obtained with this code were used in [arXiv:1707.00663](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00663).

Code is provided as is. It does contain only minimal comments and is probably most useful if you have some experience with SSE.
